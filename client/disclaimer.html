      <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Privacy and Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          We respect users' privacy and data security. Due to the use of
          end-to-end P2P transmission technology, the content of the files is
          not stored or accessed by our server. Therefore, this website cannot
          access or view any files transmitted by users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although we use the latest security technology, users still need to
          take extra precautions when transmitting sensitive files such as
          personal identity information (PII) and financial data.
